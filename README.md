## Project Overview

### **Weather Now - A Simple Weather App**

This application allows users to quickly search for the current weather in any city around the world. The app uses the Open-Meteo API to fetch real-time weather data based on a city's name, and provides the following information:

* **City Name**: Displayed prominently.
* **Temperature**: Current temperature in Celsius.
* **Weather Description**: The type of weather (clear, cloudy, etc.).
* **Wind Speed**: The wind speed in km/h.
* **Weather Icon**: A dynamic weather icon based on the weather condition.

### **Key Features**

* **Search Bar**: A text input where users can type the name of the city they wish to search.
* **Weather Display**: Displays relevant weather data such as temperature, weather type, wind speed, and an image of the weather icon.
* **Error Handling**: If no city is found or there is a network issue, users will see an appropriate error message.
* **Loading Spinner**: While fetching the weather data, a loading spinner is shown to the user.
* **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, meaning it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works

1. **City Search**: The user enters the name of a city in the search bar.
2. **API Call**: The app first calls the Open-Meteo Geocoding API to convert the city name into latitude and longitude coordinates.
3. **Weather Fetch**: Using the latitude and longitude, a second call is made to the Open-Meteo Weather API to fetch the current weather data.
4. **Display Data**: Once the data is fetched, the weather details are displayed on the page including the temperature, wind speed, weather icon, and weather description.
5. **Error Handling**: If the city is not found or thereâ€™s an issue with the API, an error message is displayed.
6. **Loading State**: While the data is being fetched, a loading spinner is shown.

## API Documentation

We are using the **Open-Meteo API** to fetch the weather data. The main endpoints used in the application are:

1. **Geocoding API**: This endpoint takes the city name and returns latitude and longitude:

   * Endpoint: `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name={city}`
2. **Weather API**: This endpoint uses latitude and longitude to get the current weather:

   * Endpoint: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude={latitude}&longitude={longitude}&current_weather=true&timezone=auto`

---

## Error Handling

The app includes basic error handling for the following cases:

* **City Not Found**: If the city entered is invalid or does not exist, the app will display a "City not found" message.
* **API Errors**: If there are any issues with fetching data from the API (network issues, API downtime, etc.), the app will show a generic error message: "Something went wrong".
* **Empty Input**: If the search bar is empty and the user tries to submit, the app won't make an API call and can display a prompt to enter a city.
